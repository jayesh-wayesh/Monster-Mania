## 🧟 Minting Monster NFTs

In order to mint monsters, you'll need to sign up as admin. Use same username as `DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT` and enter a suitable password. It'll open a page for you where you can select the monster and number of editions to be minted for that monster. All the monsters will be minted to blockchain account corresponding to `DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT`. After you've minted enough NFTs you can logout and then login back as a new user.
```
⚠️ Make sure you've minted enough number of monsters before trying out the actual game otherwise game will not work properly
